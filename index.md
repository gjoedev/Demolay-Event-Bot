### About
The demolay event bot is a Discord Bot I set up that allows Demolay chapters with their own discord servers to organize their events with this bot. Its somewhat easy to set up, and the documentation can be found [Here](https://1drv.ms/w/s!ArXnJdAp_FG1hvRZzKuX1keBNcthzA?e=5zOn43). If you need further help, contact me VIA discord at gjoe#0001

### Technical Details
The demolay event bot uses the [Discord.JS framework](https://discord.js.org/#/) and the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
