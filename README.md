# Demolay Event Bot

Hey! You found My Discord Bot! This is a discord bot for Demolay Discord Servers that want a better way to keep track of events.

# Usage
This should really only be used for Demolay Chapters that are also using a discord server. If you've found this, and your not in the order of Demolay, This project doesnt have
much use for you, I would reccomend checking out other callander bot.

# Requirnments
The following are needed to run the bot:
NodeJS, Preferably Latest version. This can be downloaded here:

[NodeJS Download (Windows)](https://nodejs.org/en/)

For Linux users, you can run:
```
sudo apt install nodejs
```

And stop where it says "Install Node.JS and get Coding"

# Downloading (Windows)
Downloading the bot is extreamly simple. Simply press the green "Code" Button at the top, and download it as a ZIP file. Extract it, and then proceed to first time startup.

#Downloading (Linux)
Because Linux doesnt support .ZIP folders (I think so, I dont use linux), you'll have to use the command line, which is still really simple. Open up the directory in a terminal, 
or navigate there using cd, then type in the follwing:
```
git clone https://github.com/gjoedev/Demolay-Event-Bot/
```
This will clone the repositry files to your directory. You can now proceed to first time startup.

# First Time Startup (Windows)
To generate the packages needed to run this bot, Simply run "FirstTimeStart.bat", Or if your an advanced windows user, open the directory in Command Prompt (Or windows terminal
if your cool), and type in:
```
npm i
```
This will install all the packages for the bot to run.

# First Time Startup (Linux)
Assuming you've installed the bot directory to linux, simply run:
```
npm i
```
Just like the cool windows installation.
